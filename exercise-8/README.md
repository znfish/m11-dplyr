# Exercise-8
In this exercise, you'll work with a dataset of **Pulitzer Prize Winning Newspapers**. Here, you'll practice data wrangling using DPLYR functions while reading in real world data. The dataset comes from [Five Thirty Eight.](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/pulitzer/pulitzer-circulation-data.csv) More information on the [Pulitzer Prize](http://www.pulitzer.org/) can be found on their website.

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository, follow the instructions in `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to Github.
