# Exercise 8: Pulitzer Prizes

# Read in the data
pulitzer <- read.csv("data/pulitzer-circulation-data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Install and load the needed libraries
# Be sure to comment out the install.packages function so it won't install it every time it runs
# Remeber you only need to install a package once
#install.packages(dplyr)
library(dplyr)

# View in the data set. Start to understand what the data columns contains
# Be sure to comment out the function so it won't view everytime you run the code.


# Use 'colnames' to print out the names of the columns


# Use 'str' to print what types of values are contained in each column
# Did any value type surprise you? Why do you think they are that type?


# Add a column in a dataframe called 'Pulitzer.Prize.Change` that contains the diffrence in changes
# in Pulitzer Prize Winners from 2004 to 2013 and Pultizer Prize Winners from 1990 to 2003.


# What publication gained the most pulitzer prizes from 2004-2014?
# Be sure to use the pipe operator! 


# Which publication with at least 5 Pulitzers won from 2004-2014 had the biggest decrease(negative) in Daily circulation numbers? 
# This publication should have Pulitzer prizes won a minimum of 5 Pulitzers, as well as the biggest decrease in circulation


# Your turn! An important part about being a data scientist is asking questions. 
# Create a question and use dplyr to figure out the answer.
